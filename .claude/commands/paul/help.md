# PAUL Command Reference

**PAUL** (Plan-Apply-Unify Loop) is a structured AI-assisted development framework for Claude Code.

## The Loop

Every unit of work follows this cycle:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PLAN ──▶ APPLY ──▶ UNIFY          │
│                                     │
│  Define    Execute    Reconcile     │
│  work      tasks      & close       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Never skip UNIFY.** Every plan needs a summary.

## Quick Start

1. `/paul:init` - Initialize PAUL in your project
2. `/paul:plan` - Create a plan for your work
3. `/paul:apply` - Execute the approved plan
4. `/paul:unify` - Close the loop with summary

Usage: `/paul:init`

---

### `/paul:plan [phase]`
Enter PLAN phase - create an executable plan.

- Reads current state from STATE.md
- Creates PLAN.md with tasks, acceptance criteria, boundaries
- Populates skills section from SPECIAL-FLOWS.md (if configured)

---

### `/paul:apply [plan-path]`
Execute an approved PLAN.md file.

- **Blocks if required skills not loaded** (from SPECIAL-FLOWS.md)
- Validates plan exists and hasn't been executed
- Executes tasks sequentially

---

### `/paul:help`
Show this command reference.

## Common Workflows

**Starting a new project:**
```
/paul:init
/paul:plan
# Approve plan
/paul:apply
/paul:unify
```

**Enterprise workflow (with audit enabled):**
```
/paul:plan        # Create plan
/paul:audit       # Audit + auto-fix plan
# Approve audited plan
/paul:apply       # Execute
/paul:unify       # Close loop
```

**Checking where you are:**
```
/paul:progress   # State + ONE next action (recommended)
```

**Resuming work (new session):**
```
/paul:resume     # Restores context, suggests next action
```

**Pausing work (before break):**
```
/paul:pause      # Creates handoff, updates state
```

**Pre-planning exploration:**
```
/paul:discuss 3       # Articulate vision
/paul:assumptions 3   # See Claude's assumptions
/paul:research "topic"  # Gather external info
/paul:plan 3          # Now create the plan
```

**Managing roadmap:**
```
/paul:add-phase "New Feature"    # Add phase
/paul:remove-phase 5             # Remove future phase
/paul:milestone "v2.0"           # Create milestone
/paul:complete-milestone         # Archive milestone
```

## Key Principles

1. **Loop must complete** - PLAN -> APPLY -> UNIFY, no shortcuts
2. **Commands are thin** - Logic lives in workflows
3. **State is tracked** - STATE.md knows where you are
4. **Boundaries are real** - Respect DO NOT CHANGE sections
5. **Acceptance criteria first** - Define done before starting
6. **Skills are enforced** - Required skills block APPLY until loaded

## Getting Help

- Run `/paul:progress` to see where you are and what to do next
- Read `.paul/PROJECT.md` for project context
- Read `.paul/STATE.md` for current position
- Check `.paul/ROADMAP.md` for phase overview
