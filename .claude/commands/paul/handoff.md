<objective>
Generate a comprehensive handoff document synthesizing session activity, decisions, gaps, and next actions.

**When to use:** End of session, context break, or when decisions need documentation.

**Smart context:** Uses conversation context for decisions/gaps. Optional argument for additional notes.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@.paul/STATE.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Optional notes: $ARGUMENTS (decisions, gaps, thoughts inline)

Session context is primary source - extract:
- What was accomplished (file changes, plans executed)
- Decisions made (explicit or implicit in conversation)
- Questions asked and answered
- Gaps identified
- User's stated intentions
</context>

<process>

<step name="gather_session_context" priority="first">
**From STATE.md:**
- Current phase and plan
- Loop position
- Last activity
- Session continuity notes

**From conversation context:**
- Files created/modified this session
- Commands executed
- Decisions discussed (look for "I want", "let's do", "decision:", user preferences)
- Questions raised (look for "?", "should we", "what about")
- Gaps identified (look for "missing", "need", "gap", "TODO")
- User's stated approach/thoughts

**From optional $ARGUMENTS:**
- Additional context user provided inline
- Override or supplement detected context
</step>

<step name="synthesize">
Combine Claude's observations with user input:

1. **Session Accomplishments:**
   - What was built/completed
   - Plans executed
   - Files created

2. **Decisions Made:**
   - Explicit decisions from conversation
   - Implicit decisions (choices made without discussion)
   - Rationale where stated

3. **Gap Analysis:**
   - Issues identified
   - User's decision on each gap
   - Effort estimates if discussed

4. **Open Questions:**
   - Unresolved items
   - Items needing more discussion

5. **Reference Files:**
   - Files mentioned that will be needed
   - Source files for next session
</step>

<step name="generate_handoff">
Create `.paul/HANDOFF-{date}-{context}.md`:

```markdown

<smart_context_detection>
**Decision indicators in conversation:**
- "I want to..." / "Let's do..."
- "Decision:" / "My decision:"
- "We should..." / "Go with..."
- User providing definitive answers
- Approval signals ("yes", "approved", "do it")

**Gap indicators:**
- "Missing..." / "We need..."
- "GAP" / "TODO"
- Questions about what doesn't exist

**Thought indicators:**
- "I think..." / "My thoughts:"
- "Here's my take..."
- User explaining reasoning

**Priority indicators:**
- Numbered lists from user
- "First..." / "Most important..."
- Effort/impact discussions
