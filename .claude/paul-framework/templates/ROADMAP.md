## Section Specifications

### Overview
**Purpose:** High-level journey description.
**Length:** One paragraph.
**Update:** When project direction changes significantly.

### Current Milestone
**Purpose:** Quick reference to active milestone.
**Contains:** Name, version, status, phase progress.
**Update:** After each phase completion.

### Phases Table
**Purpose:** At-a-glance view of all phases.
**Contains:** Phase number, name, plan count, status, completion date.
**Update:** After each plan/phase completion.

### Phase Details
**Purpose:** Detailed breakdown of each phase.
**Contains:**
- **Goal:** Specific deliverable outcome
- **Depends on:** Phase dependencies with reason
- **Research:** Likely/Unlikely with justification
- **Scope:** Bullet list of deliverables
- **Plans:** Checklist with brief descriptions

**Update:** During planning; status after completion.

---

## Phase Numbering

**Integer phases (1, 2, 3):** Planned work from roadmap creation.

**Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2):** Urgent insertions.
- Insert between consecutive integers
- Mark with [INSERTED] tag
- Include reason for insertion
- Filesystem sorts correctly: 2 < 2.1 < 2.2 < 3

**Validation for decimal insertion:**
- Integer X must exist and be complete
- Integer X+1 must exist in roadmap
- Decimal X.Y must not already exist
- Y >= 1

---

## Depth Configuration

Phase count depends on project depth:

| Depth | Typical Phases | Plans/Phase |
|-------|----------------|-------------|
| Quick | 3-5 | 1-3 |
| Standard | 5-8 | 3-5 |
| Comprehensive | 8-12 | 5-10 |

**Key principle:** Derive phases from actual work. Depth determines compression tolerance, not a target to hit.

---

## Research Flags

- **Unlikely:** Internal patterns, CRUD operations, established conventions
- **Likely:** External APIs, new libraries, architectural decisions

When `Research: Likely`:
- Include `Research topics:` field
- Consider research phase before implementation
- Discovery may be required during planning

---

## Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Not started | Phase hasn't begun |
| In progress | Actively working |
| Complete | All plans done (add date) |
| Deferred | Pushed to later (add reason) |

---

## Milestone Sections

### Active Milestone
**Purpose:** Currently executing milestone with full phase details.
**Contains:**
- Goal and status summary
- Progress bar visualization
- All phases with plan checklists
- Research flags where applicable

### Planned Milestone
**Purpose:** Defined but not started milestone.
**Contains:**
- Goal and prerequisites
- Phase table (focus areas, research likelihood)
- NOT detailed plans (added when milestone begins)

### Completed Milestones
**Purpose:** Historical record in collapsible sections.
**Contains:**
- Summary header with ship date
- Phase details (collapsed by default)
- Link to full milestone archive

**Key principle:** Completed work should not consume visual space — collapse it.
